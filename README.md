# Assembly End Game

A word-guessing challenge where you have a limited number of attempts to save a list of programming languages — or the last one, *Assembly*.
Guess the word in under **8 attempts** to keep the programming world safe from Assembly!

---

## 🎮 Overview

**Assembly End Game** is a fun, hangman-style word guessing game built with React.
The goal is simple — guess the hidden word letter by letter using your keyboard (on-screen or physical) before you run out of attempts.
Each wrong guess costs you a “language” — once you lose them all, it’s *Game Over*.
