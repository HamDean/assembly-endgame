# Assembly End Game

A word-guessing challenge where you have a limited number of attempts to save a list of programming languages — or the last one, *Assembly*. Can you guess the word before it's too late?

---

## 🎮 Overview

**Assembly End Game** is a fun, hangman-style game built with React.
The goal is simple — guess the hidden word letter by letter using your keyboard (on-screen or physical) before you run out of attempts.
Each wrong guess costs you a “language” — once you lose them all, it’s *Game Over*.

---

## ✨ Features

* Guess letters using both **on-screen buttons** and your **physical keyboard**
* **Limited attempts** — every wrong guess brings you closer to losing
* Displays correct and incorrect guesses with color feedback
* A **reset button** to start a new round anytime
* Fully functional **win/lose detection**
* Smooth and responsive gameplay built with React

---

## 🧰 Built With
